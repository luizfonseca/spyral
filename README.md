A python framework base in handlers and powered by tornado. More instructions soon :).
Currently in working progress.

Instructions
------------

- You will need setuptools + virtualenv to run (ok, that's obvious :P)

- Just clone this project and run, inside the app folder (e.g: first `cd my_app_name/`), the following command: `virtualenv --no-site-packages .` - don't forget the "." (means current location, but could be anything you want).

- Working with specific libraries? Put them in the `requirements.txt` file, with the version you need. Just please, don't remove tornado. :)

- Install the packages your application needs with `bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Your application is ready, how about start it? `python main.py`!

- Access [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and you should see a little test.

What's coming next?
------------------

- This is a "mockup" of the final framework, I'm working in different approaches to work and I'm really interested in feedback. If you have an idea about how this should be, and how to improve it, please, don't hesitate; fork, open an issue or whatever you want.
